/**
 * 组装系统提示。
 *
 * <h3>结构：分段拼装，而不是一长串字符串相加</h3>
 * 提示由四块组成，顺序即优先级（后面的不能覆盖前面的）：
 * <ol>
 *   <li>身份与环境（项目目录、平台事实）</li>
 *   <li>{@link #RULES} —— 操作规则清单</li>
 *   <li>用户配置的指令与角色卡</li>
 *   <li>子代理自己的附加指引（优先级最低）</li>
 * </ol>
 * 规则清单做成一个 {@code String[]} 常量，而不是几十行字符串相加：
 * 它是**数据**（一段一段独立的规则），不是控制流。做成数组之后，「有几条规则」
 * 一眼可数，增删一条不会碰到拼接逻辑，也方便结构测试按条检查。
 *
 * <h3>提示文本本身刻意保持不变</h3>
 * 这些英文句子是模型的**行为契约**：它们决定 agent 会不会先确认再动手、
 * 会不会声称自己做了没做的事。改写它们属于「改动行为」，与「改写实现」
 * 是两件事，必须单独评估（也要同步结构测试）。所以这里只重排了拼装方式，
 * 句子一字未动。
